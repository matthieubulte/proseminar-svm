  We present an algorithm for finding the observations relevant to classification of observations in two or more classes: the Support Vector Machine. The support observations are then used in the decision function as a linear combination, and their number allows us to derive an approximation of the classifier's performance. The kernel trick is then presented, a generic method applicable to inner product-based algorithm is shown to enable to let one incorporate domain knowledge about the classification problem in order to improve classification performance.
