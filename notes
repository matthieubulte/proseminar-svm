+ Learning with Kernels
  + Hard margin SVM : present the general idea of svm in idead
    world (linearly separable data)

    The goal of this section is to present Support Vector Machines
    and how they learn *the* optimal boundary for a two classes
    separation problem.

    + Margin maximization
    Here, we present the optimization formulation of SVMs and present
    why they lead to the optimal bouindary.

    First the optimization goal is to maximize the size of the margin
    (TODO: find a paper showing that margin maximization = best sep)

    Second show that the minimum is obtained because the optimization
    is coinvex.
    (TODO: find a proof that the Grammian matrix is positive
    semi-definite)

    + Support vectors
    Here it would be nice to have some graph sowing the conceptual
    role of the SVs, and show why they're called as such.

    Say something about how the number of support vectors helps
    approximate the out of sample error.
    (TODO: find a paper about this. it should be in any paper about
    SVMs, but a clear and quotable formulation would be good) 

    + Conclusion: Best linear separation
 
  + Drawbacks
    + Hyperparameters selection: grid search
    + Kernel selection
    + Performances
    + Extra on soft margin (introduce C tuning parameter)
    + Overfitting
      + 
    + Black box
    + Two classes only
      + Multi classes
      	+ NxN: very slow to train
	+ N: one against all
	
 + Not linear separable: the Kernel trick
    + Idea: feature extraction, going in other vector space
    + Kernel trick: same procedure with a different Gramian matrix
    + Advanced examples: infinite dimensions, RBF kernel
    + Conclusion: all problems solved, we're happy

+ intersting things
  + margin optimization is the original target and proper
    classification is a constraint. In regression it's the opposite
  + parallel to KNN for RBF Kernel with no regularization
  + SVR for
